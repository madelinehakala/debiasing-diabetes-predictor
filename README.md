## Dataset:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer
## Goal:
- Identify/Quantify biases of the dataset
- Examine how different model algorithms (SVM, KNN, NN, LR, etc.) deal with such bias
  - Understand how models are making decisions (permutation importance, gradient-based methods)
- Explore ways to address such biases (adjusted cross fold validation, bias penalties, etc.)
